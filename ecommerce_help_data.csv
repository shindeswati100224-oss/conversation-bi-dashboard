It is possible that the Seller or our delivery partners have a holiday between the day you placed your order and the date of delivery, which is based on the timelines shown on the product page. In this case, we add a day to the estimated date. Some delivery partners and Sellers do not work on Sundays and this is factored in to the delivery dates. What is the estimated delivery time? Sellers generally procure and ship the items within the time specified on the product page. Business days exclude public holidays and Sundays. Estimated delivery time depends on the following factors: The Seller offering the product Product's availability with the Seller The destination to which you want the order shipped to and location of the Seller. Why does the estimated delivery time vary for each seller? You have probably noticed varying estimated delivery times for sellers of the product you are interested in. Delivery times are influenced by product availability, geographic location of the Seller, your shipping destination and the delivery partner's time-to-deliver in your location. Please enter your default pin code on the product page (you don't have to enter it every single time) to know more accurate delivery times on the product page itself. Seller does not/cannot ship to my area. Why? Please enter your pincode on the product page (you don't have to enter it every single time) to know whether the product can be delivered to your location. If you haven't provided your pincode until the checkout stage, the pincode in your shipping address will be used to check for serviceability. Whether your location can be serviced or not depends on Whether the Seller ships to your location Legal restrictions, if any, in shipping particular products to your location The availability of reliable delivery partners in your location At times Sellers prefer not to ship to certain locations. This is entirely at their discretion. Why is the CoD option not offered in my location? Availability of CoD depends on the ability of our delivery partner servicing your location to accept cash as payment at the time of delivery. Our delivery partners have limits on the cash amount payable on delivery depending on the destination and your order value might have exceeded this limit. Please enter your pin code on the product page to check if CoD is available in your location. I need to return an item, how do I arrange for a pick-up? Returns are easy.

'In Stock' For items listed as ""In Stock"", Sellers will mention the delivery time based on your location pincode (usually 2-3 business days, 4-5 business days or 4-6 business days in areas where standard delivery service is available).
